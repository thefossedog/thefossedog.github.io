title: 'Printing Problems #2 - Holes in my hills'
---

I've started to print Nelson in earnest now.  
I've managed a three tiles, two are relatively flat, but the third one was my first attempt at some of the pretty serious hills that surround the town.

It's really the hills that are going to add a bit of drama to the model, so they need to look as good as possible.

Printing hills can actually be pretty easy, they tend to have long sweeping lines and relatively shallow slopes.  

So really easy to print hills, the caveat here though is that you require a lot of infill.
When printing with 20% infill or more I am getting nice results.  however infill takes time and wastes plastic.

I've been at looking at ways to reduce the amount of infill and still get good results.  For the most part hills look good with 10% infill, which can be seen in the image below

However, I did start to encounter problems, particularly around the summits, where I start to see gaps between the layers.  
Watching the printer in action reveals why these gaps appear.... Printing with minimal infills means that the chances of an infill line appearing directly under a summit are pretty small.  This means we are trying to lay down layers into thin air, hills don't collapse completely but the layers do sag enough to make this lacing effect and leave holes in my hills

I wasn't keen to increase the amount of infill, plus this isnt a guarantee to fix the issue. What I have tried is to increase the wall thickness, the default setting was two lines per wall.  I've shifted that up to 4 lines, and I seem to be getting some success. 

I've just kicked off a 20 hour print for a very hilly section of Nelson, so fingers crossed.  I don't mind reprinting some tiles, but when they take 20 hours each I don't want too many wasted.
