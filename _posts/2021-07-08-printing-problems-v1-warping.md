title: 'Printing Problems #1 - Warping'
---

Warping is how it sounds, the 3d print starts to curl up off the print bed as it prints and warp.

This means the layers don't lay down properly, which in turn causes problems. In extreme cases it could probably cause the printhead to clash with the print and completely detach the print from the bed.  This is pretty unlikely with a large map tile, warping does cause some pretty brutal ugliness on the prints, see the image below.

Without going into the history of 3d printing.  Warping appears to be less of a problem now than it once was, large due to heated print beds.
Warping happens when the plastic cools down at inconsistent rates.  The bed helps to alleviate this problem by keeping the layers warm

The Ender 3 has a great heated bed, however I'm still running into a few problems, this is mainly due to draughts.  It can be solved by putting the printer in a giant box to maintain a nice ambient temp, however this isnt really an option for me at the minute, so I'm trying to alleviate the draught issues in two ways

1. A big piece of cardboard on the offending side of the printer
2. moving the print back on the build plate away from the draughty side

In the print above, I moved the print back 20mm, which is possibly too far as I got warping issues on the back edge, which I haven't seen before.

For the next prints I think I try and go back to the middle of the plate and try to reduce those drafts.
