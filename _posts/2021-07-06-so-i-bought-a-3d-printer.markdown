So I bought a 3d printer. An Ender 3 to be precise.

Why did I buy a 3d printer?  well there are two reasons really
- I wanted to printer a tiny trophy for my Leicester City minifigures
- It seemed pretty cheap and interesting

I ordered direct from Creality and the printer arrived in a week, which was remarkable

It was pretty easy to assemble, I probably should have taken more time, but everything seemed to line up and the tiny dog print that comes on the micro SD card seemed to print nicely

A few false starts later, a few failed trophy attempts with models I found online didn't make me happy.  So I learned how to use Blender and made my own 3d trophy models,  the lego boys look pretty happy with the results
