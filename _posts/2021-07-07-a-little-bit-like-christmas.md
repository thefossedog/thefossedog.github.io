title: A Little bit like Christmas
---

I'll be back filling this blog with stuff that I have already done and learned.  but I wanted to quickly capture  the exciting news of yesterday.

Everything arrived in one day.

First up the courier turned up with 2kg of white PLA+ filament, which will be converted into my Nelson model.

The lovely LINZ person also came through with the Nelson point cloud that I will use to generate the model.
I had to download with FTP and its an 80gb file, so left that running overnight and it was there safely on  my HDD this morning

I'm really excited to take a look through the data and figure out my plan

The tiles came ZIPPED up, just extracting them now, I think I'll leave this running in the background...............
